Building a weather dashboard that lets the user know 
City name
Current Temp
Current Humidity
Current wind
Current UV index.
There is a search bar that you can type in the location to give you the daily forcast and also a 5 day forcast.
I used the openweather API to pull the locations, all stats that were needed and also the UV index.
